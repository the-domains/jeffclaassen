            <description><![CDATA[<p>Making this video gave me a better appreciation for the people out there posting daily vlogs. It’s a lot of work. It’s more work than you might think. Everything you do takes longer when you’re trying to document it. You have to do things like pull over while driving to adjust camera settings. Then you have to set up your camera in the car so you can still drive safely among so many other things. I know some vloggers just turn the camera on and talk to it for 5 minutes, which is hard, in a way, because being alone in a room talking to a camera feels awkward, but that sort of vlog is still a lot easier than one where somebody is setting up shots. Of course, the setting up shots method is more fun to watch because it plays like a short movie which is usually more engaging than watching somebody talk straight to the camera for an extended period of time. Anyway, blah blah blah…</p>]]></description>
