            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bunny Speed Painting - Preview of "Late Night Painting Session"</h1><p>Trying to learn Adobe Premiere by forcing myself to use it more. Anyway, this is just a just a quick clip from a longer video I uploaded a few days ago. The music is just a quick little loop I made with iElectribe, which is something I am trying to learn.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ae1f92066ef621ce99c0c44bf2c5d918f6def6f2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Unboxing: Fancy Art Prints On Aluminum</h1><p>Art prints on aluminum. I've been wanting to try this for a couple of years and finally got around to it. The prints you see are from a painting called "The Wi-Fi Is Weak Here". Enjoy!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3a996e217b2b286a7a060f7faeafa6faeeee858b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Making this video gave me a better appreciation for the people out there posting daily vlogs. It’s a lot of work. It’s more work than you might think. Everything you do takes longer when you’re trying to document it. You have to do things like pull over while driving to adjust camera settings. Then you have to set up your camera in the car so you can still drive safely among so many other things. I know some vloggers just turn the camera on and talk to it for 5 minutes, which is hard, in a way, because being alone in a room talking to a camera feels awkward, but that sort of vlog is still a lot easier than one where somebody is setting up shots. Of course, the setting up shots method is more fun to watch because it plays like a short movie which is usually more engaging than watching somebody talk straight to the camera for an extended period of time. Anyway, blah blah blah…</p>]]></description>
